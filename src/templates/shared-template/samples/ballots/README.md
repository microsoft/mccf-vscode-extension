This folder contains sample CCF ballots for various scenarios.

More information on how to vote for proposals and execute other governance operations can be found at the following links:

## Ballots generator

The CCF repository includes a [sample Jinja template](https://github.com/microsoft/CCF/tree/main/samples/templates) which will automatically build a ballot, doing a structural equality check against a target proposal.

More details on how to use the ballot templates can be found [here](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/governance/proposals.html#creating-a-ballot).
